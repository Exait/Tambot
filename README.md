Tambot is a RPG bot for Discord

  - Intricate lore
  - Cool inventory system
  - Magic!



Tambot is inspired by the Lore in the elder scrolls game, with most things, like races, classes and more



We are working really hard to make it work, which might take a while but we don't have an *actual* time just yet

### Tech

Tambot uses a few node packages to work:

* [Discord.JS] <http://discord.js.org> - Discord JS opensource API!
